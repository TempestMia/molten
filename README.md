Just a basic static site for now. 

Coming up:
Game-ification of my life!
- Motivate me to gain so 'levels' in various skills (i.e. python, javascript, deadlifting)
- Track my classes, too. Like. Level 10 Programmer / Level 8 Powerlifter
- Self-defined daily goals
- Self-defined 1-time achievements
- Oh, right, this isn't just for me. Technically for any user who wants to become awesome.
