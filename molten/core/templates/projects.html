      <p class="project-desc">
        A start-up in Toronto that provides buildings with a mesh network of sensors. The web portion allows building managers to monitor their data. I worked in Django on the web portion of things.

      <a href="https://github.com/TempestMia/wsmmo">Websocket MMO</a>
      <p class="project-desc">
        A small project to teach myself the wonderful world of websockets. It runs on Tornado and the client uses enchantjs. 
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="project-disc">
  	Disclaimer: I only recently came around to thinking maybe I should make my personal projects presentable to others, put them on GitHub as proof that yes, I do code. I'm just starting off with the websocket mmo, hopefully whenever you, dear reader, take a gander, it'll be somewhat complete (as I'm writing this, it needs a lot more work).

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tempestmia">SoundCloud</a>

      </p>
      <a href="http://fixanddamn.blogspot.ca/">Strength Training</a>

        Mostly a training journal with some entries of things I've learned or interesting things I've talked about with my friend in the academia of nutritional sciences.
